Marinas Mayhem
======

A 2d-shooter written completly in java, without the use of any frameworks. Inspired by the game tutorial by TheCherno, 
as well as the game realm of the mad god. You take the roll of my friend Marina, and work your way through her different
workplaces. The first level will be a caf√©, where you have to 'serve' coffee to all customers.
